								<h1>History</h1>
								<br />
								<p>
									Eco-Fabrics was founded in 2018 by John Doe, who at the time just graduated from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Environmental Studies. 
									As someone who grew up without the money to buy new clothes when needed, 
									he was dismayed when he learnt of just how much textiles were wasted and wanted to do something about it. 
									Before founding Eco-Fabrics, he volunteered to take in any clothes that people did not want anymore and recycle them into new clothes (also known as upscaling). 
									Feedback from these people, who were satisfied with his services, gave him the confidence he needed to expand his reach from a one-man job to an entire company.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div id="mission">
								<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
								<br />
								<p>
									Did you know? Every year, roughly 100 million tonnes of textiles end up in landfills.
								</p>
								<br />
								<p>
									Here at Eco-Fabrics, our goal is to reduce that number by providing an alternative, which is recycling them into new clothes. 
									They are then sold at cheap prices.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div id="glory">
								<h1>Historical Glory</h1>
								<br />
								<p>
									As Eco-Fabrics is still a relatively new company, we have not made as much impact on the world as we would like. 
									Of course, that is subject to change. 
									Already, we are the proud winner of the 2019 Greenest Startups Award, with hopefully more to come.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div id="support">
								<h1>Charitable Support</h1>
								<br />
								<p>
									We are a major supporter of "Caritas", 
									an organization dedicated to ensuring that everyone's basic needs are met, 
									one of which includes access to affordable clothing.
								</p>
								<br />
								<p>
									Every year, we donate at least 500 of our products, as well as our gross profits to them. 
									In return, they help us reach out to more people and organizations, persuading them to donate their unwanted textiles to us. 
									It is a win-win relationship, since as we expand, we are able to donate more of our products and gross profits to them.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div id="why">
								<h1>Product Information</h1>
								<br />
								<p>
									Our products are made from unwanted textiles, which would have ended up in landfills if it weren't for us. 
									Rest assured that these recycled clothes are just as good as any clothes you can find in regular shops, 
									for every stitch of them is meticulously crafted by highly-trained weavers who have experience in upscaling and share the same goal of reducing textile wastage.
